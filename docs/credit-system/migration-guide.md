# Migration Guide: Upgrading to Credit System

This guide helps existing ThinkTest AI users understand and migrate to the new credit system with GPT-5 and Claude 4 support.

## What's New

### New AI Providers
- **OpenAI GPT-5** and **GPT-5 Mini**
- **Anthropic Claude 4 Opus** and **Claude 4 Sonnet**
- Improved **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** integration

### Credit System
- Purchase credits to use any AI provider without API keys
- Automatic credit deduction for AI usage
- Never-expiring credits with transparent pricing
- Demo credits for new users

### Enhanced Features
- Priority processing for credit users
- Comprehensive transaction history
- Real-time credit balance monitoring
- Improved error handling and fallbacks

## Impact on Existing Users

### âœ… No Breaking Changes

Your existing setup continues to work exactly as before:

- **API Keys**: If you have configured OpenAI or Anthropic API keys, they will continue to be used first
- **Demo Credits**: Existing demo credits are preserved
- **Settings**: All your current settings remain unchanged
- **Generated Tests**: All previous test generations remain accessible

### ðŸ†• New Options Available

You now have additional options:

1. **Keep Using API Keys**: Continue as before (recommended if you have existing API keys)
2. **Purchase Credits**: Buy credits to access new AI providers without managing API keys
3. **Mix Both**: Use API keys for some providers, credits for others

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy with Current Setup

**If you're satisfied with your current API keys:**

âœ… **No action required**
- Your API keys will continue to work
- No credits will be deducted
- Access to new AI providers if your keys support them

### Scenario 2: Want to Try New AI Providers

**If you want to access GPT-5 or Claude 4:**

**Option A: Add New API Keys**
1. Get GPT-5 access from OpenAI (when available)
2. Get Claude 4 access from Anthropic
3. Add keys in Settings â†’ API Tokens

**Option B: Purchase Credits**
1. Visit `/credits` to see packages
2. Purchase credits for instant access
3. Use any AI provider without managing keys

### Scenario 3: Simplify API Key Management

**If you want to reduce API key complexity:**

1. **Purchase Credits**: Buy a credit package
2. **Remove API Keys**: Optionally remove existing API keys
3. **Unified Experience**: Use credits for all AI providers

### Scenario 4: Team/Organization Setup

**If you manage multiple users:**

1. **Centralized Credits**: Purchase credits for the organization
2. **User Management**: Users don't need individual API keys
3. **Cost Control**: Monitor usage through transaction history

## Step-by-Step Migration

### For Individual Users

1. **Assess Current Usage**
   ```bash
   # Check your current API tokens
   Visit: Settings â†’ API Tokens
   
   # Review your usage patterns
   Visit: Dashboard â†’ Recent Activity
   ```

   - Try new AI providers (GPT-5, Claude 4)
   - Monitor credit usage in dashboard
   - Review transaction history

### For Teams/Organizations

1. **Plan Migration Strategy**
   - Inventory current API key usage
   - Estimate credit needs based on usage
   - Choose centralized vs. distributed approach

2. **Gradual Migration**
   - Start with credit purchases for new providers
   - Gradually migrate users from API keys to credits
   - Monitor usage and costs

3. **Training and Documentation**
   - Train team on new credit system
   - Update internal documentation
   - Set up usage monitoring

## Cost Comparison

### API Keys vs. Credits

| Aspect | API Keys | Credits |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Setup** | Complex (multiple providers) | Simple (one purchase) |
| **Cost** | Direct billing to providers | Transparent credit pricing |
| **Management** | Individual key management | Centralized credit management |
| **Access** | Limited to your API access | All providers available |
| **Billing** | Multiple provider bills | Single ThinkTest AI billing |

### Credit Cost Examples

Based on typical usage patterns:

**Light User (5 generations/month)**
- API Keys: ~$10-15/month across providers
- Credits: Starter Pack ($9.99) = 25 credits (5+ months)

**Regular User (20 generations/month)**
- API Keys: ~$30-50/month across providers  
- Credits: Professional Pack ($29.99) = 110 credits (5+ months)

**Heavy User (50+ generations/month)**
- API Keys: ~$100+/month across providers
- Credits: Enterprise Pack ($99.99) = 600 credits (12+ months)

## Database Migration

### Automatic Migration

When you update ThinkTest AI:

```bash
# Run migrations (automatic with new version)

# Seed credit packages
php artisan db:seed --class=CreditPackageSeeder
```

### Data Preservation

- User accounts and settings
- API token configurations
- Generated test history
- Demo credit balances

### New Tables Added
